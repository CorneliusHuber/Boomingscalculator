# BoomingsCalculator
As I have been bored and needed to learn Java I started this as a fun little hobby project to practice a bit. This was December 2016. Now it is 2018 and I can actually calculate something with it. Well, actually I can do so since summer this year. This project started out in German, so I am translating it right now to English. 

Right now these features are implemented: 

 - Additions
 - Substractions
 - Multiplikations
 - Divisions
 - Roots and nth Roots
 - Potences (just natural numbers, more might follow)
 - Parentheses
 - Sinus, Cosinus, Tangens

These features are planned and might be implemented one day:

 - Variables
 - Searching for zeroes in a graph
 - Logarithm
 - differential calculus

On my todolist are these tasks:

 - Translating the source to German
 - Cleanig up source (most importantly `buffer()`)
 - Implementing Outputable in iOStreams
 - Finding a better name for iOStreams
